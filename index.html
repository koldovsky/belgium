                <img id="facts" src="pictures/facts.jpg" alt="facts" width="400" height="400">
                <ul id="list">
                    <li>The Big Bang theory originated in Belgium – it was a Belgian, the priest and physicist (apparently not a contradiction in terms) Georges Lemaitre, who first came up with what is now called the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe in 1927. The theory is often attributed to Edwin Hubble, although records show Lemaitre published a similar theory two years before Hubble.</li>
                    <li>Brussels South Charleroi Airport is the most punctual airport in Europe – and it is ranked as the world's second best airport for on-time performance, just behind Japan's Osaka International, in OAG's punctuality report.</li>
                    <li>Cricket is thought to be a Belgian invention, not British – academics believe immigrants from north Belgium could have imported the game to Britain, based on a poem thought to have been written in 1533 that calls Flemish weavers ‘king of crekettes’ and also mentions ‘wickettes’, predating English references dating to the 1600s.</li>
                    <li>Belgian men are the second tallest in the world – with a height of 181.7cm, only Dutchmen are taller at 182.5cm. The same can't be said for Belgian women, however, who rank 21 at 165.5cm tall.</li>
                    <li>The highest point in Belgium is lower than the world's tallest building – the Signal de Botrange on the High Fens plateau in far-east Belgium is the highest point at 694m, shorter than the world's tallest building in Dubai, the Burj Khalifa at 828m. Belgium along with the Netherlands and Luxembourg are historically known as the Low Countries.</li>
                    <li>Belgium was the world's second country to legalise same-sex marriage – Belgium introduced same-sex marriage in 2003, after the Netherlands. Euthanasia was also legalised in 2002.</li>
                    <li>Belgians are accredited to inventing the Body Mass Index (BMI), the saxaphone and plastic – among a number of other world-changing inventions, such as co-designing the World Wide Web, Imodium, inline skates and a safe contraceptive pill. Read about the top inventions you didn't know were Belgian.</li>
                    <li>The Law Courts of Brussels is the world's largest court of justice – with a construction area of some 26,000sqm, it is bigger than St Peter’s Basilica in Rome by 5,000sqm. On the topic of construction, the façade of Brussels' Royal Palace is 50 percent longer than Buckingham Palace.</li>
                    <li>Europe’s first skyscraper was built in Belgium – known as the Torengebouw in 1928 in Antwerp. It is still the tallest building in Antwerp today at around 96m (26 floors).The art-deco edifice, now known as Boerentoren or KBC Tower, was the tallest building on the continent until 1940 when Terazza Martini Tower opened in Genoa, Italy. Belgium is also attributed to having Europe’s oldest shopping arcades, The Galeries St Hubert, which opened in Brussels in 1847.</li>
                    <li>The name ‘Belgium' comes from the Romans – when they called their province in the north of Gaul Gallia Belgica, after its previous inhabitants the Celtic and German Belgae. Belgium's official name today is the Kingdom of Belgium, known in the country's three official languages as Koninkrijk België (Dutch), Royaume deBelgique (French) and Königreich Belgien (German). King Philippe of Belgium is the current monarch.</li>
                    <li>The longest tram line in the world is the Belgian Coast Tram – the Kusttram travels the full 68km of Belgian coast between the French and Dutch borders, making some 68 stops from Knokke-Heist to De Panne and running every 10 minutes during summer peak hours.</li>

                <h2>BRUSSELS</h2>
                <p>Belgium's fascinating capital, and the administrative capital of the EU, Brussels is historic yet hip, bureaucratic yet bizarre, self confident yet unshowy, and multicultural to its roots. All this plays out in a cityscape that swings from majestic to quirky to rundown and back again. Organic art nouveau facades face off against 1960s concrete developments, and regal 19th-century mansions contrast with the brutal glass of the EU’s Gotham City. This whole maelstrom swirls out from Brussels’ medieval core, where the Grand Place is surely one of the world’s most beautiful squares.</p>

                <h2>ANTWERP</h2>
                <img id="antwerp" src="pictures/Antwerp.jpg" alt="antwerp" width="600" height="420">
                <p>Belgium’s second city and biggest port is Antwerp (Antwerpen/Anvers in Dutch/French) and without a doubt, this charming city is the country’s capital of cool. It's long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painter Pieter Paul Rubens, as you’ll be regularly reminded – there are numerous places to admire his works across the city. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive cathedral. Today Antwerp’s top drawcards are its truly vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.</p>
                <h2>MECHELEN</h2>
                <img id="mechelen" src="pictures/Mechelen.jpg" alt="mechelen" width="600" height="420">
                <p>Mechelen is a city and municipality in the province of Antwerp, Flanders, Belgium. The municipality comprises the city of Mechelen proper, some quarters at its outskirts, the hamlets of Nekkerspoel (adjacent) and Battel (a few kilometers away), as well as the villages of Walem, Heffen, Leest, Hombeek, and Muizen. The Dyle (Dutch: Dijle) flows through the city, hence it is often referred to as the Dijlestad ("City on the river Dijle").Mechelen lies on the major urban and industrial axis Brussels–Antwerp, about 25 km from each city. Inhabitants find employment at Mechelen's southern industrial and northern office estates, as well as at offices or industry near the capital and Zaventem Airport, or at industrial plants near Antwerp's seaport.</p>
                <h2>GHENT</h2>
                <img id="ghent" src="pictures/ghent.jpg" alt="ghent" width="600" height="420">
                <p>Ghent is a city and a municipality in the Flemish Region of Belgium. It is the capital and largest city of the East Flanders province and after Antwerp the largest municipality of Belgium. The city started as a settlement at the confluence of the Rivers Scheldt and Leie and in the Late Middle Ages became one of the largest and richest cities of northern Europe, with some 50,000 people in 1300. It is a port and university city.</p>

                <h2>BEER</h2>
                <img id="beer2" src="pictures/beers.jpg" alt="beers">
                <p>Belgium is the fatherland of quality beer brewing, creating a huge variety of beer styles from well established Pale Ales, Saisons, Tripels and Dubbels to the more unusual Flemish sours, Lambics and Geuzes.It is also the spiritual home of Trappist beer as it can claim 6 of the 11 breweries in the world where Trappist monks lovingly craft beer (and usually cheese) to support the charitable works of their monastery.  The tradition of having a specific design of beer glass also originates here as each brewery insisted on the local surroundings serving their beer in a particular type of glass.  Even to this day the Belgian beer scene is hugely regionalized around the local brewery with most pubs and restaurants in an area promoting the local beer.   With such a rich history Belgium is therefore the place to go for any true beer lover wanting to sample the delights of Westmalle, Duvel, St Bernardus, Rochefort, Bosteels Kwak, Delirium Tremens, Maredsous, Rodenbach….the list goes on!</p>
                <h2>CHOCOLATE</h2>
                <img id="chocolate" src="pictures/choco.jpg" alt="choco">
                <p>Belgium enjoys a reputation among chocolate aficionados that is only rivalled by Switzerland. Indeed, these two countries are the only places where the use of “chocolate” is legally restricted to products containing only cocoa butter, cocoa solids, sugar and milk. Today, around 172,000 tonnes of chocolate products are manufactured each year in Belgium, by around 500 different manufacturers, sold through 2,000 specialist shops. Average annual sales equate to 8kg per head of population, though many of these sales are to foreign tourists or are export sales.</p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Marriage. </b>
                        There are no social or ethnic barriers to marriage, although proximity and social models influence the choice of a spouse. Young people marry and have children less often and later than former generations did. The divorce rate has increased to about one in three marriages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Domestic Unit. </b>
                        The domestic unit usually is composed of the parents and up to three children, although immigrants from North Africa often have more children. Women still do more of the domestic work, but this is perceived as a matter of negotiation by the couple.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Inheritance. </b>
                        In the absence of a will, the children inherit equally from a deceased parent. However, if one spouse survives the other, he or she keeps the entire estate. The law limits the proportion of the estate that can be disposed of by will, depending on the number of children.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Kin Groups. </b>
                        The extension of the family group generally is limited to first cousins. However, there are a growing number of family associations in the upper and middle classes through which the descendants of an individual gather once or twice a year.
